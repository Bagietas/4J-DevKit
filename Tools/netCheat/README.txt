Tutorials:
	Available on my youtube: www.youtube.com/dlsamer

Compile:
	Written in Visual Studio 2013 (C#)
	Uses Telerik for Codelist GUI

Run:
	If you want to use the Target Manager API, just install the ProDG TM v420.1.14.7 on your PC and be on compatible DEX
	If you want to use the Control Console API, just install CCAPI 2.60 rev3 on your PC and PS3
	If you want to use the PS3 Manager API, just install it on your PS3
	In the APIs tab double click what API you'd like to use
	
Tips:
	Double click on a plugin to open/close it
	Double click a code to toggle constant write (or click on Constant Write checkbox)
	Ctrl-C on result(s) will copy them into the clipboard in code format
	Search results do not automatically refresh
	When you test a subroutine and you want to update it after already writing it, click Reset Written
		Then you can replace the code and write again without a possible freeze

If you want to make a plugin I suggest watching my tutorial on how and installing the template in the Plugins folder:

Enjoy.
