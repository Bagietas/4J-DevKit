Pretty much all of the code behind this feature: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/6334/Plug-ins-in-C
Without "Redth" I wouldn't have been able to add this to NetCheat.

If you want an example then look in the Kingdom Hearts 1.5 folder.
Add the Plugin.cs file in the Plugin Default directory into your solution with Project->Add Existing Item.

Source for NetCheatMemoryViewer is available on my github: www.GitHub.com/Dnawrkshp

The NetCheatPS3 Plugin Template Installer.vsix file will install a standard template for a NetCheat plugin.
It will be listed under Visual C# in Visual Studio 2012 (only) UNDER .NET v3.5. So select .NET 3.5 on the top left bar first.
